#ASSIGNMENT 1
#Write a console application that collects two sets of numbers from a user
#Add the first and second number
#Then report the result of the addition like this: "number .... plus number .... is equal to ....."

# SOLUTION 1
point_1 = int(input('Insert length: ' ))
point_2 = int(input('Insert width: ' ))
total_length = point_1 + point_2
print(f'The total length is obtained when {point_1}m is added to {point_2}m which is equal to {total_length}m.')
Area_1 = point_1 * point_2
print(f'The Area is obtained when {point_1}m is multiplied by {point_2}m which is equal to {Area_1}m.')
Average = point_1 / point_2
print(f'The total length is obtained when {point_1}m is divided by {point_2}m which is equal to {Average}m.')


# ASSIGNMENT 2
# Write a console application that greets someone
# Whatever name the user typed, it will say: "You are blessed ...."

# SOLUTION 2
name = input('Username:  \n')
print(f'You are blessed {name}!')

#Then say: "your OTP is ....""

# SOLUTION 3
import random
OTP_code = random.randrange(100000,999999)
print(f'OTP: {OTP_code} expires after one minute.')
